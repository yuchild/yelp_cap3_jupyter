# Yelp Recommender Systems for Scottsdale Arizona

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create recommenders to help users find establishments they like in Scottsdale Arizona. There are two types of recommenders employed to service this goal: collaborative filtering and content based recommenders. The collaborative filters separates pivots users and business on average user ratings. The content based recommender uses review text and categories of businesses on their vectorized cosine similarities.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python and Libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, keras, surprise, wordcloud, matplotlib)
* Docker (for Tensorflow GPU)
* flask (api, not operational yet)
* Postman (api, not operational yet)

## Project Description
The project is based on the open yelp dataset found [here](yelp.com/dataset). The recommenders will mainly come from three sources: user.json, review.json, and business.json, which will be merged to create a super table based on the feature business_id. 


(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
